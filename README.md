## EEGFrame

### Description
The framework currently supports the analysis of standard EDF records via signal inspection, feature extraction, and feature vectors storage for knowledge discovery.
EEGFrame is the result of refactoring and extension of the HRVFrame framework (http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~ajovic/hrvframe/hrvframe.html) for heart rate variability analysis, with added methods for EEG analysis. 
It supports numerous linear and nonlinear methods.
(Still buggy and unfinished)
